        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Marcus Aurelius was Roman emperor from 161 to 180 and a Stoic
          philosopher. He was the last of the rulers known as the Five Good
          Emperors and the last emperor of the Pax Romana, an age of relative
          peace and stability for the Roman Empire. He is best known for his
          philosophical work "Meditations," written in Greek while on campaign
          between 170 and 180.

      <h2>Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        As a practitioner of Stoicism, Marcus Aurelius believed in the
        development of self-control and fortitude as a means to overcome
        destructive emotions. His personal writings on Stoic philosophy, now
        commonly known as "Meditations," are still revered as a literary
        monument to a government of service and duty.
